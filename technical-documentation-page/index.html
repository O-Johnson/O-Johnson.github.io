      <p>
        TypeScript is a free and open-source high-level programming language developed by Microsoft that adds static typing with optional type annotations to JavaScript. It is designed for the development of large applications and transpiles to JavaScript. Because TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, all JavaScript programs are syntactically valid TypeScript, but they can fail to type-check for safety reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications for both client-side and server-side execution (as with Node.js, Deno or Bun). Multiple options are available for transpilation. The default TypeScript Compiler can be used, or the Babel compiler can be invoked to convert TypeScript to JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        TypeScript supports definition files that can contain type information of existing JavaScript libraries, much like C++ header files can describe the structure of existing object files. This enables other programs to use the values defined in the files as if they were statically typed TypeScript entities. There are third-party header files for popular libraries such as jQuery, MongoDB, and D3.js. TypeScript headers for the Node.js library modules are also available, allowing development of Node.js programs within TypeScript
      </p>
      <p>
        The TypeScript compiler is itself written in TypeScript and compiled to JavaScript. It is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. Anders Hejlsberg, lead architect of C# and creator of Delphi and Turbo Pascal, has worked on the development of TypeScript.

      <p>
        TypeScript was released to the public in October 2012, with version 0.8, after two years of internal development at Microsoft. Soon after the initial public release, Miguel de Icaza praised the language itself, but criticized the lack of mature IDE support apart from Microsoft Visual Studio, which was not available on Linux and OS X at that time. As of April 2021 there is support in other IDEs and text editors, including Emacs, Vim, WebStorm, Atom and Microsoft's own Visual Studio Code. TypeScript 0.9, released in 2013, added support for generics.
      </p>
      <p>
        TypeScript 1.0 was released at Microsoft's Build developer conference in 2014. Visual Studio 2013 Update 2 provides built-in support for TypeScript. Further improvement were made in July 2014, when the development team announced a new TypeScript compiler, asserted to have a five-fold performance increase. Simultaneously, the source code, which was initially hosted on CodePlex, was moved to GitHub.
      </p>
      <p>
        On 22 September 2016, TypeScript 2.0 was released, introducing several features, including the ability for programmers to optionally enforce null safety, to mitigate what's sometimes referred to as the billion-dollar mistake.
      </p>
      <p>
        TypeScript 3.0 was released on 30 July 2018, bringing many language additions like tuples in rest parameters and spread expressions, rest parameters with tuple types, generic rest parameters and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        TypeScript 4.0 was released on 20 August 2020. While 4.0 did not introduce any breaking changes, it added language features such as Custom JSX Factories and Variadic Tuple Types.
      </p>
      <p>
        TypeScript 5.0 was released on 16 March 2023 and included support for decorators.
      </p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Design">
      <header><h2>Design</h2></header>
      <p>
        TypeScript originated from the shortcomings of JavaScript for the development of large-scale applications both at Microsoft and among their external customers. Challenges with dealing with complex JavaScript code led to demand for custom tooling to ease developing of components in the language.
      </p>
      <p>
        TypeScript developers sought a solution that would not break compatibility with the standard and its cross-platform support. Knowing that the current ECMAScript standard proposal promised future support for class-based programming, TypeScript was based on that proposal. That led to a JavaScript compiler with a set of syntactical language extensions, a superset based on the proposal, that transforms the extensions into regular JavaScript. In this sense, the class feature of TypeScript was a preview of what to expect from ECMAScript 2015. A unique aspect not in the proposal, but added to TypeScript, is optional static typing (also known as gradual typing) that enables static language analysis to facilitate tooling and IDE support.

          <h3>Compatibility with JavaScript</h3>
          <p>
            TypeScript is a strict superset of ECMAScript 2015, which is itself a superset of ECMAScript 5, commonly referred to as JavaScript. As such, a JavaScript program is also a valid TypeScript program and a TypeScript program can seamlessly consume JavaScript. By default the compiler targets ECMAScript 5, the current prevailing standard, but is also able to generate constructs used in ECMAScript 3 or 2015.
          </p>
          <p>
            With TypeScript, it is possible to use existing JavaScript code, incorporate popular JavaScript libraries, and call TypeScript-generated code from other JavaScript. Type declarations for these libraries are provided with the source code.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Type annotations</h3>
          <p>
            TypeScript provides static typing through type annotations to enable type checking at compile time. This is optional and can be ignored to use the regular dynamic typing of JavaScript.
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code class="block-code">
function add(left: number, right: number): number {
  return left + right;
}
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            Primitive types are annotated using the types <code>number</code>, <code>boolean</code>, and <code>string</code>. These types are distinct from their class counterparts (<code>Number</code>, <code>Boolean</code>, etc), which cannot have operations performed from values directly. For instance, a <code>Number</code> and a <code>number</code> cannot be added. There is additionally <code>undefined</code> and <code>null</code> types for their respective values.
          </p>
          <p>
            All other types are annotated using their class name rather than primitives, such as <code>Error</code>. Some types take in generic parameters, such as a <code>Promise</code> — a promise to a string would be annotated as <code>Promise&lt;string&gt;</code>. Arrays can be written in two different ways which are both syntactically the same: the generic-based syntax <code>Array&lt;T&gt;</code> and a shorthand with <code>T[]</code>. Generic types can additionally be chained, so a <code>Promise</code> to an <code>Array</code> of strings could be written as <code>Promise&lt;Array&lt;string&gt;&gt;</code> (or <code>Promise&lt;string[]&gt;&lt;/string&gt;</code> using the shorthand array style).
          </p>
          <p>
            Additional built-in data types are: <code>Tuple</code>, <code>Union</code>, <code>never</code> and <code>any</code>. An array with predefined data types at each index is a <code>Tuple</code>. A variable that can hold more than one type of data is a <code>Union</code> type. The <code>never</code> type is used when a given type should be impossible to create. Weakly or dynamically-typed structures can use the <code>any</code> type to avoid errors, although this is generally discouraged practice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Type annotations can be exported to a separate <span class="italics">declarations file</span> to make type information available for TypeScript scripts using types already compiled into JavaScript. Annotations can be declared for an existing JavaScript library, as has been done for Node.js and jQuery.
          </p>
          <p>
            The TypeScript compiler makes use of type inference to infer types when types are not given. For example, the <code>add</code> method in the code above would be inferred as returning a <code>number</code> even if no return type annotation had been provided. This is based on the static types of <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> being <code>numbers</code>, and the compiler's knowledge that the result of adding two <code>numbers</code> is always a <code>number</code>. However, explicitly declaring the return type allows the compiler to verify correctness.
          </p>
          <p>
            If no type can be inferred because of lack of declarations, then it defaults to the dynamic <code>any</code> type. A value of the <code>any</code> type supports the same operations as a value in JavaScript and minimal static type checking is performed for operations on <code>any</code> values
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Declaration files</h3>
          <p>
            When a TypeScript script gets compiled there is an option to generate a <span>declaration file</span> (with the extension <code>.d.ts</code>) that functions as an interface to the components in the compiled JavaScript. In the process the compiler strips away all function and method bodies and preserves only the signatures of the types that are exported. The resulting declaration file can then be used to describe the exported virtual TypeScript types of a JavaScript library or module when a third-party developer consumes it from TypeScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            The concept of declaration files is analogous to the concept of header files found in C/C++.
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code class="block-code short-scroll">
declare namespace arithmetics {
  add(left: number, right: number): number;
  subtract(left: number, right: number): number;
  multiply(left: number, right: number): number;
  divide(left: number, right: number): number;
}
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            Type declaration files can be written by hand for existing JavaScript libraries, as has been done for jQuery and Node.js.
          </p>
          <p>
            Large collections of declaration files for popular JavaScript libraries are hosted on GitHub in <a href="https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped" target="_blank">DefinitelyTyped.</a>

        <div>
          <h3>Classes</h3>
          <p>
            TypeScript supports ECMAScript 2015 classes that integrate the optional type annotations support.
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code class="block-code scroll">
class Person {
  private name: string;
  private age: number;
  private salary: number;

  constructor(name: string, age: number, salary: number) {
      this.name = name;
      this.age = age;
      this.salary = salary;
  }

  toString(): string {
      return `${this.name} (${this.age}) (${this.salary})`; // As of version 1.4
  }
}
            </code>
          </pre>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Generics</h3>
          <p>
            TypeScript supports generic programming. The following is an example of the identity function.
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code class="block-code">
function id&lt;T&gt;(x: T): T {
  return x;
}   
            </code>
          </pre>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Union types</h3>
          <p>
            Union types are supported in TypeScript. The values are implicitly "tagged" with a type by the language, and may be retrieved by "typeof()".
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code class="block-code short-scroll">
function successor(n: number | bigint): number | bigint {
  return ++n
}
            </code>
          </pre>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Enumerated types</h3>
          <fieldset>
            <legend>
              TypeScript adds an 'enum' data type to JavaScript.
            </legend>
            <pre>
              <code class="block-code short-scroll">
enum Cardsuit {Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades};
var c: Cardsuit = Cardsuit.Diamonds;
              </code>
            </pre>
          </fieldset>
          <fieldset>
            <legend class="space">
              By default, enums number members starting at 0; this can be overridden by setting the value of the first:
            </legend>
            <pre>
              <code class="block-code short-scroll">
enum Cardsuit {Clubs = 1, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades};
var c: Cardsuit = Cardsuit.Diamonds;
              </code>
            </pre>
          </fieldset>
          <fieldset>
            <legend class="space">All the values can be set:</legend>
            <pre>
              <code class="block-code short-scroll">
enum Cardsuit {Clubs = 1, Diamonds = 2, Hearts = 4, Spades = 8};
var c: Cardsuit = Cardsuit.Diamonds;
              </code>
            </pre>
          </fieldset>
          <fieldset>
            <legend class="space">
              TypeScript supports mapping the numeric value to its name. For example, this finds the name of the value 2:
            </legend>
            <pre>
              <code class="block-code short-scroll">
enum Cardsuit {Clubs = 1, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades};
var suitName: string = Cardsuit[2];

alert(suitName);
              </code>
            </pre>
          </fieldset>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 class="space">Modules and namespaces</h3>
          <p>
            TypeScript distinguishes between modules and namespaces. Both features in TypeScript support encapsulation of classes, interfaces, functions and variables into containers. Namespaces (formerly internal modules) utilize immediately-invoked function expression of JavaScript to encapsulate code, whereas modules (formerly external modules) leverage JavaScript library patterns to do so (AMD or CommonJS).

          <h3>Compiler</h3>
          <p>
            The TypeScript compiler, named <code>tsc</code>, is written in TypeScript. As a result, it can be compiled into regular JavaScript and can then be executed in any JavaScript engine (e.g. a browser). The compiler package comes bundled with a script host that can execute the compiler. It is also available as a Node.js package that uses Node.js as a host.
          </p>
          <p>
            The current version of the compiler supports ECMAScript 5 by default. An option is allowed to target ECMAScript 2015 to make use of language features exclusive to that version (e.g. generators). Classes, despite being part of the ECMAScript 2015 standard, are available in both modes.

However, ESLint's inability to leverage TypeScript's language services precluded certain forms of semantic linting and program-wide analysis. In early 2019, the TSLint team announced the linter's deprecation in favor of <code>typescript-eslint</code>, a joint effort of the TSLint, ESLint and TypeScript teams to consolidate linting under the ESLint umbrella for improved performance, community unity and developer accessibility.
