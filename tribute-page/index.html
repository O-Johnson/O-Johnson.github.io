            <p><strong>Music</strong></p>
            <p>
              Kuti's musical style is called Afrobeat. It is a style he largely
              created, and is a complex fusion of jazz, funk, highlife, and
              traditional Nigerian, African chants and rhythms. It contains
              elements of psychedelic soul and has similarities to James Brown's
              music. Afrobeat also borrows heavily from the native "tinker pan".
              Tony Allen, Kuti's drummer of twenty years, was instrumental in
              the creation of Afrobeat. Kuti once stated that "there would be no
              Afrobeat without Tony Allen". Tony Allen's drumming notably makes
              sparing use of 2 & 4 backbeat style playing, instead opting for
              outlining the time in shuffling hard-bop fashion, while
              maintaining a strong downbeat. There are clear audible musical
              similarities between Kuti's compositions and the work of
              electric-era Miles Davis, Sly Stone and Afrofunk pioneer Orlando
              Julius.

            <p><strong>Activism</strong></p>
            <p>
              Kuti was highly engaged in political activism in Africa from the
              1970s until his death. He criticized the corruption of Nigerian
              government officials and the mistreatment of Nigerian citizens. He
              spoke of colonialism as the root of the socio-economic and
              political problems that plagued the African people. Corruption was
              one of the worst political problems facing Africa in the 1970s and
              Nigeria was among the most corrupt countries. Its government
              rigged elections and performed coups that ultimately worsened
              poverty, economic inequality, unemployment, and political
              instability, further promoting corruption and crime. Kuti's
              protest songs covered themes inspired by the realities of
              corruption and socio-economic inequality in Africa. Kuti's
              political statements could be heard throughout Africa.

            <p><strong>Political Views</strong></p>
            <p>
              Kuti's lyrics expressed his inner thoughts. His rise in popularity
              throughout the 1970s signaled a change in the relation between
              music as an art form and Nigerian socio-political discourse. In
              1984, he critiqued and insulted the authoritarian then-president
              of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari. "Beast of No
              Nation", one of his most popular songs, refers to Buhari as an
              "animal in a madman's body"; in Nigerian Pidgin: "<i
                >No be outside Buhari dey ee / na craze man be dat / animal in
                craze man skini.</i
              >" Kuti strongly believed in Africa and always preached peace
              among its people. He thought the most important way for them to
              fight European cultural imperialism was to support traditional
              religions and lifestyles in their continent. The American Black
              Power movement also influenced Kuti's political views; he
              supported Pan-Africanism and socialism and called for a united,
              democratic African republic. African leaders he supported during
              his lifetime include Kwame Nkrumah and Thomas Sankara. Kuti was a
              candid supporter of human rights, and many of his songs are direct
              attacks against dictatorships, specifically the militaristic
              governments of Nigeria in the 1970s and 1980s. He also criticized
              fellow Africans (especially the upper class) for betraying
              traditional African culture.
